Overview

   PulseAudio Volume Meter (pavumeter) is a simple GTK volume meter for
   the [18]PulseAudio sound server.

   Everybody loves [19]screenshots.

Current Status

   Works perfectly.

Documentation

   There is not much to say. Just run pavumeter and see yourself. You may
   specify the source to monitor on the command line. If ommited the
   daemon's default source is selected.

Requirements

   Currently, pavumeter is tested on Linux only.

   pavumeter was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   September 2004, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and
   maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf for source code
   configuration.

   pavumeter requires [20]gtkmm installed.

   Obviously pavumeter requires an installation of [21]PulseAudio
   (version 0.9.2).

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of pavumeter.

Acknowledgements

   None so far.
