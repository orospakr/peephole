*** Peephole ***

A D-Bus service for accessing dot-matrix and segmented LCD displays.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

python-dbus
python-usb (aka python-pyusb)
python-gobject

python-nose (aka nosetests), python-pmock, and python-coverage for
running the test suite

Running Directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run Peephole directly out of the tree and avoid installing
anything, put Peephole.conf into /etc/dbus-1/system.d/.  This
file defines what users and processes are allowed to access
the Peephole service.  This step is not optional.

Then execute:

./run

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installation procedure is provided by a standard Python
distutils setup.py script.  However, until I add the
necessary logic to setup.py, you still have to copy the
`Peephole.conf` file into:

/etc/dbus-1/system.d/

And then copy the `ca.infoglobe.peephole.service` file into:

/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/
